			<p>Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus has built a reputation for delivering flagship tier features at wallet-friendly prices, giving the likes of Apple and Samsung a run for their money.
	
			</p>
			<p>
				The problem is that an aggressively low price meant it was largely chasing trends rather than creating its own, making it difficult for the company to differentiate itself from the competition beyond price alone. This all changes with the company's latest effort, the OnePlus 7 Pro, which comes with the first truly all-screen display devoid of any obtrusive notch cutout or punch-hole camera. The quality of the display also happens to be the most impressive on any smartphone to date.
			</p>
			<p>The bezel-free 6.67-inch OLED display spills to the edges much like the curved displays seen on recent Galaxy phones, and touts a refresh rate of 90Hz instead of the usual 60Hz, making UI navigation and scrolling through apps and webpages look much smoother. We also tried out a few Android games that support the 90Hz refresh rate and the on-screen action felt incredibly responsive. There's also a new haptic motor that provides more nuanced vibrational feedback in games such as Asphalt 9, which felt great.</p>
